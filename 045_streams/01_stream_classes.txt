- The I/O classes begin with a system of template classes.
- Standard C++ creates two specializations of the I/O template classes: one for 8-bit characters and another for wide characters.

- The C++ I/O system is built upon two related but different template class hierarchies:
    - The first is derived from the low-level I/O class called basic_streambuf.
      This class supplies the basic, low-level input and output operations, and provides the
      underlying support for the entire C++ I/O system. Unless you are doing advanced I/O
      programming, you will not need to use basic_streambuf directly.

    - This is a high-level I/O class that provides formatting, error checking, and status information
      related to stream I/O.
      basic_ios is used as a base for several derived classes, including basic_istream, basic_ostream, and basic_iostream
